Billy decides to do something interesting. He had been playing a game which has quite engrossed him, and now he wanted to actually see how he has been fairing in this game. So he decided to take the help of his friend Pyth, who with his Data Science skills, decided to help him. Billy gave Pyth a dictionary where he as stored his scores of the last 30 days. Help Pyth in processing the data and plotting a graph to show Billy’s progress graph in the last 30 days.

    1. First create an array Scores[] by extracting the scores from the dictionary Billy provided.
    2. With the help of numpy functions, create another array Days[] consisting of numbers 1 to 30.
    3. Plot the Score vs. Days graph, with X axis named as “Score”, and Y axis named as “Days”.
    4. Find the Mean, Median, Min and Max of Billy’s Scores with the help of Numpy Functions and display it to him so he can          improve his game-play.
